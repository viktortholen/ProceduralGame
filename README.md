# ProceduralGame
Procedural game level generation in Unreal Engine 4

# Relevant code
The relevant code that is used for the generation of the map can be found in the Source/Procedural folder, where the main file is called MapGenerator. This is the code for the Actor that generates the map. Other files that were done by me are the Room and Tile-files.
